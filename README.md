# 👋 Hi, I’m Rojin Sharma  

**Full-stack Developer & Aspiring ML Engineer**  
I enjoy building products that solve real problems — from AI-powered learning tools to context-retrieval apps. My focus is blending clean engineering with applied machine learning to create tools that scale.

## 🚀 What I’m Building
- **[Study Bee](#)** – a full learning platform with course creation, document management, quizzes, event tracking, and an AI study assistant (RAG + Pinecone).  
- **[Recall Ray](#)** – a context-retrieval engine where users connect Gmail, Slack, Zoom, Docs, etc., and get semantic search across all tools. Currently migrating it to MCP (Multi-Channel Platform).  
- **[QuizRush](#)** – a gamified, AI-powered quiz app built in Flutter with retry mode, leaderboard, and AI answer explanations.  
- **[CHAT_WITH_EXPRESS](#)** – simple Node.js + Express chatbot exploring conversational logic.  
- **Gemini AI Chatbot** – an app with Express.js backend and Gemini API integration.  
- **MERN E-Commerce Site** – fully-functional store with cart, auth, and payments.  
- **Unity AR Game** – built in C# as a university project.  
- **Flutter Apps** – login/auth flows, quizzes, and UI experiments.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Building **scalable AI-powered apps** (vector databases, MCP platforms)  
- Advanced **ML/DL** through bootcamps + self-study  
- Optimizing **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions & Vercel

## 🎯 Fun Facts
- I love analyzing real-world problems in education and building products around them.  
- Big believer in **project-based learning**: each repo reflects an idea tested in practice.  
- Outside coding: fitness & strength training (working towards 75 kg 💪).
